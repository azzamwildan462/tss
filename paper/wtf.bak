\begin{abstract}
	Indonesia Smelting Technology (IST) is an industry below Toyota Tsusho Corp that focuses on producing aluminum liquid. The melted aluminum liquid will be used by CMWI (Central Motor Wheel Indonesia) to make the wheel rims. IST has a vision to become a smart factory that utilizes the latest technology in its operations. One of the technologies that can be implemented is autonomous vehicles, which can transport a dangereous aluminum liquid (molten) from IST to CMW. The total weight of the molten aluminum liquid is around 1.8 tons, and the total weight that the vehicle need to carry is 4.8 tons. Previously, IST has used a small train with a rail to transport the molten aluminum liquid, but this method has several limitations, such as the need for a rail infrastructure that very expensive and the limited flexibility of the vehicle. So, IST wants to implement an autonomous vehicle that can transport the molten aluminum liquid without the need for a rail infrastructure. The autonomous vehicle will be equipped with a navigation system that can detect the lane and obstacles, and can navigate autonomously to the destination. The navigation system will use a combination of machine learning and graph-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to achieve this goal. The machine learning algorithm will be used to detect the lane and obstacles, while the graph-based SLAM will be used to estimate the pose of the vehicle and create a map of the environment. The result of this research is a cm level error (below 1 cm) in robot pose estimation and a lightweight machine learning model that can run only on CPU with below 10 ms inference time.

\section{Background}
Indonesia Smelting Technology (IST) is an industry below Toyota Tsusho Corp that focuses on producing aluminum liquid. The environment in IST is very dangereous because of the molten aluminum liquid that has a temperature of around 700 degrees Celsius. The production goes in 24 hours a day. The production team divided into four shifts.

\section{Literature Review}
There are several studies to dive deeper into the topic of autonomous vehicle navigation systems. These studies focus on various aspects, including pose estimation, road detection, and SLAM implementation.
